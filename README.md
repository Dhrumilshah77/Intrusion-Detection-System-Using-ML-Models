# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-ML-Models
With increasing cyber threats, traditional security often falls short. Advanced solutions like ml-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are vital. The CICIDS2017 dataset, has diverse, realistic attack simulations, is crucial for training model to detect subtle anomalies. Our research enhances IDS accuracy, efficiency, bolstering network defenses.
